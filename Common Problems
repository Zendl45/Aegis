## Problem Statement

Most users approve tokens using unlimited allowances, often without fully
understanding the risks involved. While this approach is convenient, it creates
a significant on-chain attack surface.

### Key Risks
- Malicious contracts can drain user wallets
- Compromised routers can overspend approved tokens
- Users rarely revoke existing approvals
- Approval risks are difficult for users to understand and monitor

Once an approval is granted, users typically have no on-chain protection
mechanisms in place if a contract behaves maliciously or is later compromised.
