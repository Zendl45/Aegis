## Benefits

The protocol provides a safety-first layer that improves user protection
without disrupting existing DeFi infrastructure.

### Key Advantages
- Reduces user fund loss from compromised approvals
- Lowers support and incident response overhead
- Improves user trust in token approvals
- Requires minimal changes to existing frontends
- Does not interfere with AMM or execution logic
- Does not affect pricing, slippage, or routing behavior

This protocol operates purely as a safety layer and does not act as a competing
execution or liquidity system.
