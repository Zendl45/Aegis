## How It Works

Instead of approving a DEX router directly, the user creates a permission with
explicit, predefined constraints.

### Execution Flow
When a dApp or DEX attempts to execute an action:

1. The protocol verifies that the requested action is permitted
2. The protocol checks that the transaction amount does not exceed the
   per-transaction spending limit
3. The protocol verifies that the total allowed spend has not been exhausted
4. The protocol checks that the permission is still within its valid time window

If any of these checks fail, the transaction reverts.

If all checks pass, the transaction executes normally without modification.

All validation and enforcement occur fully on-chain and atomically.
