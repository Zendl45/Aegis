# Aegis Protocol

> Non-custodial permission firewall for on-chain safety.

Aegis is a non-custodial permission firewall designed to reduce user fund loss
caused by unlimited token approvals, compromised dApps, malicious upgrades,
or wallet drains.

## Key Features
- On-chain spending limits
- Per-transaction caps
- Time-bound approvals
- Action-scoped permissions

## Design Goal
Improve user safety while preserving existing swap, liquidity,
pricing, routing, and execution flows.
