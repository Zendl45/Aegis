## Transaction Reverts

A transaction is automatically reverted when any of the following conditions
are met:

- The per-transaction spending limit is exceeded
- The total allowed spending limit has been exhausted
- The permission has expired
- The requested action is not within the approved scope

All failure conditions are deterministic, enforced fully on-chain, and
designed to fail safely without risking user funds.
