## Solution Overview

This protocol introduces a permission layer between users and decentralized
applications (dApps) to enforce fine-grained, on-chain safety controls.

### Core Capabilities
- Enforces a maximum spend per transaction
- Enforces a maximum cumulative spend
- Restricts the specific actions a spender can perform
- Automatically expires permissions after a defined period
- Reverts any transaction that violates configured constraints

## Non-Goals
- The protocol does not custody user funds
- The protocol does not modify swap or execution logic
- The protocol does not alter pricing or routing mechanisms
