## Example Scenario

A user wants to trade using a decentralized exchange while limiting potential
downside risk.

### User-Defined Permission
The user creates a permission with the following constraints:
- Total spending limit: $1,000 (from an initial balance of $100,000)
- Per-transaction limit: $200
- Validity period: 7 days or more
- Allowed action: Swap only

### Attack Attempt: Single Transaction
If a malicious contract attempts to drain $1,000 in a single transaction:
- The transaction exceeds the per-transaction limit of $200
- The protocol automatically reverts the transaction
- No funds leave the user’s wallet

### Attack Attempt: Multiple Transactions
If a malicious contract attempts to drain funds using multiple transactions:
- Each transaction is capped at $200
- Once the total spending limit of $1,000 is reached, all subsequent transactions revert
- The maximum possible loss is limited to $1,000 instead of the full $100,000 balance

### Automatic Expiry
- The permission expires automatically after the defined validity period
- No manual approval revocation or user intervention is required
