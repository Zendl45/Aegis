## Action-Scoped Permissions

Permissions are strictly scoped to specific actions and cannot be reused
outside their approved intent.

### Examples
- A permission that allows swaps cannot be used to add liquidity
- A permission that allows NFT trades cannot be used to bridge assets
- Any attempt to perform an unapproved action is automatically rejected

If a transaction attempts to execute an action outside the permitted scope,
the protocol reverts the transaction on-chain.

By enforcing action-level restrictions, the protocol significantly reduces
the blast radius of compromised or malicious integrations.
